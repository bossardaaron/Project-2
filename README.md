# Project-2
# Visualizing Historical Earthquakes by Decade with Leaflet

We used the National Earthquake Information Center (NEIC) data which determines the location and size of significant earthqakes that occured worldwide from 1965 until 2016. The data came in a CSV format. We read that data through Python and cleaned it. From there, we converted the file to a SQLite file. 

Once we had the data set in our SQLite database, we used flask and python to jsonify our data. We used leaflet and leaflet.timeline.slider courtesy of Sol Vitkin to allow navigate our map, by decade. 

We also used D3 and JQuery in completing this project.
